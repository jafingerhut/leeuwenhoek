# leeuwenhoek

Putting some Clojure, compiled to JVM byte codes, under the
microscope, to see if we can learn anything therefrom.

Named in honor of [Antonie van
Leeuwenhoek](https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/leeuwenhoek.html)

## Usage

Prerequisites:
* Tested on macOS and Linux systems -- no attempt to test on Windows yet
* JVM installed as `java` somewhere in your command path
* `clojure` command installed via instructions [here](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)

To run some experiments with logging of JIT compilation and GC
enabled, which I have seen demonstrates an effect where it appears
that a Clojure function run the first time, optimized by the JVM at
tier 3, runs about 3 to 4 times faster than when it is later optimized
by the JVM at tier 4.

```bash
$ ./tryme.sh
```

To run several variations of that Clojure function, one which is
identical to the one exercised by the `tryme.sh` command, and several
which do not exhibit the slower execution on the second and later
calls, and thus are probably optimized just as fast at tier 4 JIT
compilation as they were at tier 3.

```bash
$ ./variations.sh
```

To run the same code as the `tryme.sh` script does, but also with
`-XX:+PrintAssembly` JVM option enabled, so that if you have the
appropriate shared library installed, every time the JIT compiler
generates native machine code for a method, it will be printed.

On an Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 Linux system, I have had some success
running [`./bin/ubuntu-hsdis-install.sh`](bin/ubuntu-hsdis-install.sh)
to install the necessary shared library in the proper place for
several flavors of OpenJDK.

```bash
$ ./gonative.sh
```

This command runs nearly identical code to the `variations.sh` script
above, but nearly all of the runs are the 'slow' ones.  What is it
about this small change to the way these functions are called that
prevents them from JIT-compiling to the faster versions?

```bash
$ ./variations2.sh
```
